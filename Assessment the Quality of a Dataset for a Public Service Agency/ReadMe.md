These projects are a part of the council’s new data initiative:

- Public Tree Data Provide a list of all trees in the borough, which can be downloaded by the public for free from the Camden Council website. The Borough of Camden is committed to the “opendata” initiative and are interested in opening their data as much as possible to its citizens and to the world.
- Tree Walks Brochures Create a series of “Tree Walks” brochures, each one of which is a guided walk around an individual park showing a map of the location of interesting trees.
- Environment Report Put up a single page on the Camden Council website showing the total carbon and pollution benefit provided by all their trees. This will also show information about trees removed, trees planted and the net carbon and pollution impact of this activity.

Data we have:

- Trees Data A list of all the trees in the borough (both their location and types). This is an Excel file which was downloaded from the Council website.
- Environmental Data An extract from the council assets database which lists all the trees and gives some environmental data about each tree. This is a csv file.
- Common Names Data A list of scientific tree names and their matching common names. It was got from a horticultural website and it’s in json format.

The team are unsure as to whether the data they have can be used to deliver these projects.

The task is to evaluate the data and determine the extent to which this is possible.
